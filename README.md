Completed 5 exercises on the principles of SOLID. Each exercise is designed to demonstrate one principle.

1. SRP (Single Responsibility) - "Fleet Management System"
2. OCP (Open/Closed) - "Car Rental Cost Calculator"
3. LSP (Liskov Substitution) - "Vehicle Classification System"
4. ISP (Interface Segregation) - "Maintenance Service"
5. DIP (Dependency Inversion) - "A car sales platform with bank approval"

I decided to do everything in one style for clarity.
